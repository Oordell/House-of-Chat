This file documents how much time I've spend solving this task.

The most challenging task was integration of Facebook and Google sign-in, both with their api's, 
but also with Firebase Authentication. It took me a long time of debugging and searching to find 
out, that authentication of Facebook users doesn't work when using Expo as I do. For some other 
reason, Facebook sign in couldn't work on physical Android devices. I thought about leaving out 
the "Sign in with Facebook"-button, and just stick with Google, but I left it, as it still works 
(without authentication) on iOS, and android simulators.

As I got the task prior to Christmas, I had some time to think it over, and think about how I 
would solve it. However, I didn't allocate any actual time in the beginning for planing the project,
nor did I start on the project before the agreed on dates. However Sunday was mostly spend on 
documenting the project, and testing it on different platforms.
